# WordGraphs
D3-compatible JSON graphs of words of one-letter difference, organized by word length


## Words

These are JSON-formatted, D3-compatable lists of words, showing words that are one change away: FOR being one letter different from FAR and FAR being one letter different from BAR, etc.

## Process

These graphs were created using Perl and the Graph module, and converted using Graph::D3. 

## Licencing

This is data, not code, so it is licensed as CC0 rather than using a software-appropriate license.
